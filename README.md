# House-price-prediction-linear-regression
Build a deep learning model to predict the housing price in King county area.
Convolutional Neural network and rectified linear unit (ReLU) is used as activation function. Decreasing value of loss
function is visualized to show the performance of model and the Mean Absolute Error and Mean Squared Error is used for
the evaluation of model accuracy.
